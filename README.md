# Valr.Net

Valr.Net is a wrapper for the Varl API as found on [Valr](https://docs.valr.com/#intro). 

The library relies on [CryptoExchange.Net](https://github.com/JKorf/CryptoExchange.Net), please support [Jan Korf](https://github.com/JKorf) for all his hard work.

## Status
The libary has been complete with all the basics to connect with the exchange, there is currently an issue with the account websockets where the connection is being closed as soon as it is established.

## Donate / Sponsor

If you enjoy the library and want to help with the late nights, buy me a coffee.
